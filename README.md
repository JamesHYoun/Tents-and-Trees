The image depicts the middle stage of the game.

Initially, the game starts with just trees and empty (black) squares.
The goal is to fill all empty squares with either grass or tents.

The numbers across the top and down the side tell you how many tents should be in the respective row or column.
Tents may never be adjacent to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, nor diagonally.
At the end, there must be an equal number of tents and trees. 
Each tent must correspond to exactly one tree and this tent must be vertically or horizontally but not diagonally adjacent to the tree.
It follows from the above rules that a tree can be adjacent to at most 2 tents either both vertically or both horizontally.
