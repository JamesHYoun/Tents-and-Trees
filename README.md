Your job is to place tents next to trees. Each tent is attached to one tree, there are as many tents as there are trees. The numbers across the top and down the side tell you how many tents are in the respective row or column. A tent can only be found horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tree. Tents are never adjacent to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, nor diagonally. A tree might be next to two tents, but is only connected to one. You can check a tree to indicate you've found the tent for it.
