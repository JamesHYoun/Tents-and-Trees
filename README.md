The image depicts the middle stage of the game. <br />
Black:       Empty <br />
Light-Green: Grass <br />
Dark-Green:  Tree <br />
Red:         Tent <br />

Initially, the game starts with just trees and empty (black) squares. <br />
The goal is to fill all empty squares with either grass or tents. <br />
 
The numbers across the top and down the side tell you how many tents should be in the respective row or column. <br />
Tents may never be adjacent to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, nor diagonally. <br />
At the end, there must be an equal number of tents and trees. <br />
Each tent must correspond to exactly one tree and this tent must be vertically or horizontally but not diagonally adjacent to the tree. <br />
It follows from the above rules that a tree can be adjacent to at most 2 tents either both vertically or both horizontally. <br />
